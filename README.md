# musicWebApp

Goal:
To make a website that allows users to make AI music videos.

Status 7/7/2025:

Switched to clerk for auth as it removes a lot of complexities when running my own auth (including user authorization, security, token expirarion, implementing refresh tokens, etc...)

TODO:
- begin implementing bark voice model
- Security measures tbd: honeypot, recaptcha
